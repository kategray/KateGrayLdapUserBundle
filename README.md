# KateGrayLdapUserBundle
This bundle adds support for read and write user management in LDAP for FOSUserBundle.

Note:  This bundle is not currently in a usable state.  It is inspired by (and shares
some design similarities with https://github.com/Maks3w/FR3DLdapBundle, which is 
recommended for read-only installations.

This bundle implements LDAP-based user management for Symfony applications.  It 
requires FOSUserBundle and Twig.
